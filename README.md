# FlashNN ⚡

### Neural Network Simplified 🔥

**FlashNN** is a compact neural network project built using PyTorch, designed to explore fundamental deep learning concepts and serve as a launchpad for experimenting with different architectures. The goal behind this project is to solidify my understanding of core neural network components and gain hands-on experience with PyTorch while keeping the model lightweight and adaptable.

### Expanding My Knowledge 📚

Working on FlashNN has been a great way to refine my skills in building neural networks from scratch. It’s allowed me to dive deeper into the practical side of machine learning, balancing theoretical learning with real-world implementation. Going forward, I plan to expand this project to experiment with advanced features like custom loss functions, dynamic layers, and possibly incorporating computer vision techniques.

### Key Features 🌟

- 🔹 **Minimalistic Design**: Only includes the essential layers needed for a simple neural network.
- 🔹 **Easy to Modify**: The straightforward structure makes it easy to tweak and build upon.
- 🔹 **Built for Learning**: Perfect for anyone looking to start with PyTorch or quickly prototype ideas.

### Future Enhancements ✨

I plan to extend FlashNN with more layers, experiment with hyperparameter tuning, and test it on different datasets to see how it scales. The vision is to convert this base model into a versatile template for a variety of applications, from image classification to natural language processing.

### Testing and Results 📊

Here’s where I’ll add sample results and images in the future:
